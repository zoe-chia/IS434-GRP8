Here is their story from the first e-bike / ski adventure after lockdown:\n\n\"Sixty-six days of waiting, patience, fear and respect, while coping with a confusing threat. Simone\u2019s proposal finally gives us some hope. \n\nWe are in Cogne. It is late May, but snow conditions are still good in the area on the border between Valle d\u2019Aosta and Piedmont. We brave 800 meters of difference in altitude, helped by our ebikes. The forced break has prevented us from keeping fit, and the energy saved in this first part will be needed later on. \n\nWe see the peak, Tete de la Nuova, a little known mountain just over 3,000 meters in altitude. After a few hours I realize that I have covered another 800 meters of difference in altitude, the toughest ever, to the point that it seems to be double that. With this feeling, and stiff legs, we reach the hill and cycle along a magnificent aerial ridge. \n\nOnce we reach the summit an incredible scene opens us before us, from Mont Blanc to Grivola, from Tersiva to Monviso. We change gear and start the much desired descent.It\u2019s time to draw our line, sliding lightly and respectfully on the spring snow. \n\nThe taste of this voluntary \u201cisolation\u201d in the mountains is decidedly different from the one we have just experienced: it tastes of freedom, and as the great alpinist Reinhold Messner said \u201c\u2026we do not climb a mountain to reach a peak but to return among men\u2026every time we return it\u2019s a boost of energy and renewed desire to live\u201d. \n\nDescending to the valley we enjoy the warmth of the setting sun right to the end, and, strengthened by the emotions we have just experienced, we return to a world that is trying with much effort to go back to normality.\"\n\nPhotos by Pierre Lucianaz & Alex d'Emilia", "hashtags": [], "likes": 4018, "comments": 13}, {"caption": "Prior to second lockdown in the UK the @cannofwaves crew headed to the Highlands.
