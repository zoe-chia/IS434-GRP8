Often times they do it for free. Sometimes they do it for beer. \nIn 2018 alone we had 1,411 employee hours volunteered for advocacy, and donated $400,155 to support new trails and for trail maintenance on existing trails.\nMost importantly we work with and support many amazing North American trail advocacy organizations including Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz (MBoSC), Land Trust of Santa Cruz County (LTSC), Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), Trans-Cascadia, Central Oregon Trail Alliance (COTA), Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA), and more. \nAnd over the last couple years we have been expanding our reach to international trail advocacy efforts world-wide. \nWe can post pretty bike pictures all day long, in fact we love posting those pics, but without the help of all the people and organizations mentioned above there would be a lot less awesome trails out there for all of us to ride on. \nHow can you help? Search online or ask your local bike shop if there are local trail building groups you can assist. Get involved and do what you can.

Uninhibited by foothills on the eastern side the range rises sharply and splits upper Wyoming and lower Idaho in two. On one side sits Jackson Hole, home to the legendary ski area and playground to outdoor junkies. On the other resides the Teton Valley: a landscape dotted with hay farms and the small rustic towns of eastern Idaho. Smack in the middle, off the pass that separates the two, lies some of the most progressive mountain bike trails in America. Local riders teaming with the Forest Service have created a network of trails designed and built specifically for riding. We explored both sides of the pass and rode varied terrain from purpose-built bike park features to backcountry singletrack, clinging to the edge of 10,000-foot peaks. The experience instilled a sense in us that the locals have got it figured out here\u2026 and the need for a satellite Yeti office in JH. #ProvenHere #Tetons video online now at YetiCycles.com",

Before we knew it we had found our groove for the week; building lines, riding at the edge of our limits, and enjoying the quaint and laid back atmosphere of Green River.

We easily move on with the comfort knowing that the collective scrutiny produced the right direction.\u2800 \u2800\nThe 2018 bike line is not the result of a one or two-year development project.

He attended his own school of hard knocks and every trip offers its own lessons and successes. Here is Joey\u2019s advice to anyone taking on their first bike adventure: \u201cThe first and most important step is to commit 100% to going. Make the time, pick the route, and go. Finding a good route can be challenging, but scouring blogs, picking friends brains, searching maps, and obsessing over Google Earth until you find the route you are looking for usually does the trick. There are trails everywhere, and some great resources online for planning.\u201d\n.\n\u201cThe next step is to figure out what gear is best for you, and best for the adventure at hand. Asking the right questions helps to dial in your adventure and make sure you are prepared. Will you be camping? Will it be cold? Hot? What are your water sources? Are these good sources? Are there any huts or towns along the way? How many days do you want to go for? How much food will you need? What gear can you bail on?\u201d\n.\n\u201cAsk yourself any and all questions you can muster, and hopefully you\u2019ll be prepared enough. The best way to figure out your adventure planning though is previous experience. Every trip and adventure you go on, learn from it, figure out what worked best, and build off that on your next adventure. That\u2019s really the best way to dial things in.\u201d #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth",

For all you #bikenerds out there, here is his SB100 spec run down. \"I built my 100 for light enduro\\ down country use. I am running @srammtb Eagle XX1, Guide Ultimate brakes 180mm front and rear. The fork is a 130mm Pike that slackens the bike to about 67 degrees. I slapped a 36T chainring for max output and 150mm reverb seat post. Current tires are @maxxistires 2.5 Minnion DHF, 2.3 Aggressor combo on Roval Traverse SL Carbon 31mm id wheels. Final details are a 750mm wide bars, 50mm stem, MRP 1X chainguide and @ergonbike GD1 grips and saddle.\" Nate took this rig to Moab @endurocupmtb and placed second.

Think global, act local, right? I rode from my backdoor, pedaling, then pushing, and finally shouldering my #SB140 to the top of the nearest peak, 4600 ft above home, where I knew, even between lockdowns, I\u2019d find no-one else. Alone for a night, surrounded by huge vistas and a vast starry sky, I had the chance to find some context in the strange and challenging world that had suddenly fallen on us, reconnecting with the dirt, the rocks, and the damp grass around my bivouac and refocussing on life skills at their simplest level; brewing tea and listening out for wolves.\n\nIt was just one night. But it was one night when I had certainty in 10 months of chaos, and I\u2019m thankful for that.

We shared this with our friends at the races, at festivals and ultimately at Yeti Tribe Gatherings, where hundreds gather each year to ride epic trails, and enjoy the camaraderie of post ride beers and stories\u202ftogether.\n\nWe\u2019ve referred to this crew as the Yeti Tribe \u2013 a community of people who love to ride mountain bikes.\u202fThe notion of\u202ftribe\u202fwas appealing to us because it was community-centric, familial, and had strong social values.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve learned our use of\u202fthe\u202fterm\u202f\u201cTribe\u201d\u202fcan be offensive to indigenous people, due to the violent history they have endured in the United States. \u202fThe word \u201cTribe\u201d is a colonial construct that was used to marginalize Native Americans and its continued use by non-Indigenous People fails to accurately recognize their history and unique status as Tribal Nations.\n\nAfter discussion with members of the indigenous community, studying\u202faccurate representations of our shared\u202fhistory, and reflecting on our values as a company, Yeti Cycles has decided we will no longer use the term \u201cTribe\u201d in our marketing.\n\nThe community we have built will move forward and thrive. Yeti Gatherings will continue to be our most valued events of the year. We have walked away from a word, but the soul of our community remains intact. We ask you all to join us in embracing this change.\n\nThanks to the mountain bike community for your guidance and especially to the members of the Indigenous community for educating us on this issue.\n\nSee you on the trail.\n\nChris + Hoog",

It removes a hair of the initial suppleness, but makes the bike incredibly composed when you are on the gas.\n\n3. This bike likes responds increasingly favorably as rider input progresses, even in the gnarliest terrain.

Cut the corners by clearing them completely, switchback to switchback and back into the future. The Insurgent doesn\u2019t try to win enduro tracks.

Every ride still deals the moments & feels that I can\u2019t put words to. The bike is a complete weapon, so I want to try and describe my set up without writing a data script. \n\nOne thing to note is I\u2019m not a numbers guy - I go by feel, then learn what the numbers are...plus over time I\u2019ve figured out what I like anyways. Shorter, longer, lower, squishier, whatever it is...it\u2019s simplified when you feel out what you like. Bikes are rockets, not rocket science. \n\nI\u2019m running a Large frame(120mm 29er) with the flip chips in X-LOW on 170mm cranks - no clearance problems for me. The large frame gives stability while I keep the feel of a low BB & snappy rear end. A nice, short 31mm @chromagbikes Hifi stem keeps the cockpit tight along with full length 800mm OSX bars. I have mega confidence in traction thanks to running @tannusarmour tubeless inserts inside @maxxistires 2.5 Minion DHF\u2019s front & back, paired with @industry_nine Enduro 305\u2019s, underneath @rockshox Pike Ultimate & trunnion mounted SuperDeluxe Ultimate. Everything in that set up is predictable & easy to tweak per riding conditions. I\u2019ve been riding the same complete @srammtb X01 Eagle AXS drivetrain & Reverb (aside from black chain upgrade), and all of it has been flawless. They\u2019ve taken a beat down and the system continues to work perfect. AXS is simple, quiet, and clean. I\u2019ll be just fine if I never go back to cable shifting\ud83d\ude1d Lastly, I don\u2019t know the weight of the bike, but it feels just right.

There\u2019s nothing we enjoy more than blasting berms, high fives, and sharing the riding stoke with as many of you as we can. But here at Evil we don\u2019t take things lightly when it comes to the health and well-being of our family or our global Evil community so we would like to share some information on our response to COVID-19:\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2022\tAll staff have been asked to work remotely from home. We are here to answer your questions, accept orders and ship them in a timely manner.  We\u2019ve taken precautions to ensure our health and safety and minimize any risk of transmission within the community.\u2063\n\u2022\tAll those of you eagerly awaiting your new Following.  Pre-orders are on schedule to ship barring any government restrictions. \u2063\n\u2022\tTransit time has not been affected in areas without quarantines so shipments should arrive on time.  We will be doing our best to get products to areas with quarantines in place as quickly and efficiently as possible.\u2063\n\u2022\tFor the next few months, all scheduled demos have been postponed. We love getting out and seeing you all enjoying the stoke and trying, maybe for the first time, our bikes, but the latest federal guidelines limit gatherings to no more than 10 people in one place and we all know Evil demos draw a larger crowd than that. \u2063\n\u2022\tBoth our Bellingham, WA and Madrid, Spain offices are closed to visitors. This is not to be rude, it\u2019s a best practices case and we will update you when this changes.

Going over the frame and the suspension design, it's apparent that this bike was created with a lot of thought and attention, and built with the riding here in the Pacific Northwest in mind. I really like that it looks different from any other aggressive trail bikes on the market and most importantly, I love the ride characteristic that a high-pivot design provides.

The size and position of our idler pulley is critical, giving our bikes the efficient pedalling ability they\u2019re known for. By carefully positioning the pulley, which is offset from the main pivot, we were able to fine-tune the anti-squat characteristics. Our bikes, therefore, exhibit what we have determined to be the ideal amount of anti-squat at sag to deliver a very stable pedalling response. \u2060\n.\u2060\nUnlike traditional non-idler equipped designs we can achieve these levels of anti-squat with virtually no pedal kickback. This is great for flat pedal riders but it also means that the suspension remains fully active during pedalling efforts and in turn affords perfect traction on technical and punchy climbs.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#highpivotwitchcraft #forbiddenbike #forbiddendruid\u2060\n.\u2060\nPhoto: @andylloyder", "hashtags": ["highpivotwitchcraft", "forbiddenbike", "forbiddendruid"], "likes": 2740, "comments": 15}, {"caption": "How would you build yours? \n.\nHere\u2019s how @lewbuchanan built his new Druid - for reference: Lewis is 5\u201911\u201d (180cm) tall.\n.\nFrame: Size Large, Cosmic Eggplant\nFork: @fox 36 Elite, Grip2, 150mm travel\nShock: @fox DHX2\nBars: @renthal_cycling FatBar Carbon 35, 30mm Rise, 770mm\nStem: @renthal_cycling Apex stem 35, 40mm length\nGrips: @renthal_cycling Lock-On Ultratacky\nBrakes: @trpcycling DHR\nRotors: @trpcycling 223mm rotors front and rear\nWheels: @ethirteencomponents LG1 R Enduro Carbon, 29\" front and rear \nChainguide: @ethirteencomponents\nTyres: @maxxisbike Assegai 2.5 front and Minion DHF rear\nShifter: @trpcycling 12-speed\nCassette: Eagle\nDerailleur: @trpcycling 12-speed \nPedals: @crankbrothers Mallet DH\nCranks: @ethirteencomponents LG1, 170mm arm length\nChainring: @ethirteencomponents 36 Tooth\nSeat post: @sdgcomponents Tellis, 170mm drop\nSaddle: @sdgcomponents Bel-air V2\nMudguard: @mudhugger2 Shorty\n.\n#forbiddenbike #forbiddendruid #highpivotwitchcraft\n.\n\ud83d\udcf7 @alexridesmtb", "hashtags": ["forbiddenbike", "forbiddendruid", "highpivotwitchcraft"], "likes": 4440, "comments": 57}, {"caption": "Traction and stability equate to more confidence, and in turn fun, on the bike.

Designed around a 170mm single crown fork (you can run 160 and 180mm if you want), our advice for anyone looking to adopt a dual crown setup for their Dreadnought is to set your sights on something with 180mm travel - while dual crown forks tend to have shorter axle to crown measurements (compared to a single crown fork), anything over 180mm will not only throw the geometry out, it will also destabilise your bike\u2026\n.\nWith its high single pivot and 154mm of travel, the option of building something as ludicrous as a dual crown Dreadnought is one you won\u2019t regret, just keep fork travel to 180mm and you\u2019ll be golden!\n.\n#highpivotwitchcraft #forbiddenbike #fearnothing\n.\nVideo: @chaptstudios / Rider: @billyspurway", "hashtags": ["highpivotwitchcraft", "forbiddenbike", "fearnothing"], "likes": 1973, "comments": 16}, {"caption": "NZ park hits with Andrew Clark\u2026\n.\n#highpivotwitchcraft #forbiddenbike #fearnothing \n.\nRider: @andrewclarkmtb", "hashtags": ["highpivotwitchcraft", "forbiddenbike", "fearnothing"], "likes": 3722, "comments": 16}, {"caption": "Dishing out the steeze aboard his Dreadnought, UK team rider James Leech is another of our flat pedal aficionados\u2026\u2060\n.\u2060\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about how our bikes work and why they're a firm favourite with those who prefer not to 'clip in', please hit the link in our bio.\u2060\n.\u2060\n#highpivotwitchcraft #forbiddenbike #fearnothing\u2060\n.\u2060\nPhotography & design: @chaptstudios / Rider: @jamesleech1", "hashtags": ["highpivotwitchcraft", "forbiddenbike", "fearnothing"], "likes": 2161, "comments": 8}, {"caption": "New year, new faces and we are thrilled to not only confirm Connor Fearon's arrival, but that Alex Storr is now on the Forbidden Synthesis team.

Bringing a rider into the factory team, from our ambassador program, is the icing on the cake for us and we can't wait to see what he'll get up to this year, on and off the race track.\n.\nOur homegrown team members, Magnus Manson (who\u2019s been instrumental in the development of our downhill ambitions) and Rhys Verner, will continue to fly the Forbidden Synthesis flag and we can not wait to see these two back between the tape, where they belong!\n.\nSo, now that the cat's out of the bag, let's dig into the details. We'll have two programs under the Forbidden Synthesis umbrella; one focussing on the World Cup, with Connor and Magnus, and the other on the @worldenduro, with Rhys and Alex. Connor will continue to dabble in enduro, schedule permitting. \n.\nThe other awesome piece of news - that we are equally excited to share - is that Mathieu Dupelle will be the team manager for the foreseeable future. Matt's a legend on the circuit and brings a wealth of knowledge to the Forbidden family. Joining him will be Anthony Poulson, aka Ant-Man, as well as additional mechanics TBA.

I earned the privelege of rappeling out of a perfectly good helicopter. I became a combat nurse. Most importantly, I understood how it felt to be a part of something bigger than myself. I learned how to live and work with individuals whose opinions differed vastly from my own. People who had different backgrounds and cultures than mine and whose beliefs and values were in opposition to my own would become my close friends, comrades and family. I am no longer a soldier.

Here is their story from the first e-bike / ski adventure after lockdown:\n\n\"Sixty-six days of waiting, patience, fear and respect, while coping with a confusing threat. Simone\u2019s proposal finally gives us some hope. \n\nWe are in Cogne. It is late May, but snow conditions are still good in the area on the border between Valle d\u2019Aosta and Piedmont. We brave 800 meters of difference in altitude, helped by our ebikes. The forced break has prevented us from keeping fit, and the energy saved in this first part will be needed later on. \n\nWe see the peak, Tete de la Nuova, a little known mountain just over 3,000 meters in altitude. After a few hours I realize that I have covered another 800 meters of difference in altitude, the toughest ever, to the point that it seems to be double that. With this feeling, and stiff legs, we reach the hill and cycle along a magnificent aerial ridge. \n\nOnce we reach the summit an incredible scene opens us before us, from Mont Blanc to Grivola, from Tersiva to Monviso.
